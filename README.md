# serverSideAPIs - Weather Dashboard
In this project, we will show weather information based off a city input by the user.

Once the User inputs a city into the search function, they will receive information displayed about current weather conditions. Those include:
- The city name, followed by the current date
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- UV Index
- 5-Day Forecast in cards:
    - Dates for the upcoming days
    - Temperature
    - Humidity

As the user searches cities, those resultes will generate under the search bar. I have included a click function that will allow the user to click the result that will swiftly bring back the current conditions of that city, with the five-day forecast at the click of a button. All stored and saved by local storage.
